A public GitHub template repository that bakes in DevOps hygiene and optional AI assistance. Use it to start any Node/TypeScript project with:

- ‚úÖ CI pipeline (pnpm, Node 20): lint ‚Üí typecheck ‚Üí test ‚Üí build
- üîí Security-by-default: CodeQL + Dependabot
- üóíÔ∏è Changelog discipline: PR template + guard, Keep a Changelog, AI‚Äëdrafted release notes
- üß≠ Conventional Commits enforced via commitlint
- üìö Docs-as-code with architecture diagram and contributor guides
- ‚öñÔ∏è Employer‚Äëfriendly Apache‚Äë2.0 license

## What‚Äôs inside

```text
 TODO: add tree output
```

---

## Quickstart

Clone (or use this as a template) then:

```pwsh
pnpm install     # install deps + setup husky hooks
pnpm verify      # run lint + typecheck + test + build
pnpm build       # compile TypeScript
node dist/index.js
```

Open `src/index.ts`, make a change, re-run `pnpm build` and execute again. For commit message help run `pnpm commitlint` after a few local commits.

See contribution details in [docs/repo/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/repo/CONTRIBUTING.md). For conduct expectations read [docs/repo/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](docs/repo/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Security reporting process: [docs/repo/SECURITY.md](docs/repo/SECURITY.md).

## Scripts

- `pnpm lint` ‚Äî lint placeholder (swap in ESLint later)
- `pnpm typecheck` ‚Äî TypeScript project check
- `pnpm test` ‚Äî test placeholder (swap in Vitest later)
- `pnpm build` ‚Äî compile to `dist/`
- `pnpm verify` ‚Äî run lint + typecheck + test

## Copilot features (optional)

Enable GitHub Copilot (org or user level) ‚Äî no repository secret required.

Copilot-assisted flows:

- **In-editor suggestions**: accelerate implementation & tests.
- **PR summaries (beta/feature flagged)**: generate a summary of changes; adapt into the `## Changelog` block.
- **Release note drafting**: when creating a GitHub Release, use "Generate release notes" then refine with Copilot Chat.
- **Changelog bullets**: ask Copilot Chat: _"Summarise the diff for PR #123 into Keep a Changelog Added/Changed/Fixed bullets"_.

Planned automation (optional): a future workflow can collect commits since last tag and open a draft PR; you then use Copilot to polish wording.

## CI/CD

- CI runs on every PR and push to `main|master`.
- Pipeline: checkout ‚Üí pnpm setup ‚Üí install ‚Üí lint ‚Üí typecheck ‚Üí test ‚Üí build.
- CodeQL scans JS/TS on PR and weekly schedule.
- Dependabot opens weekly npm update PRs.

**Recommended next steps (Phase 2):**

- Matrix builds (Node 18/20/22)
- Preview deploy (develop) vs release (main)
- SBOM & license scan

See the Mermaid diagram in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Security

- Code scanning via CodeQL
- Dependency updates via Dependabot
- Vulnerability reports: see [docs/repo/SECURITY.md](docs/repo/SECURITY.md)

Case study: A short write-up describing the commitlint design and trade-offs is available at `docs/case-study/commitlint-case-study.md`. You can keep it as documentation for maintainers or remove it from template projects if you prefer a leaner repo.

**Branch protection (suggested):**

- Require PR review (‚â•1)
- Required checks: CI, PR changelog guard

## Changelog & releases

We follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) + SemVer. See [docs/repo/CHANGELOG.md](docs/repo/CHANGELOG.md) for history and [CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md](./docs/CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md) for how to write entries.

- Write PRs with a `## Changelog` section (example entries in [CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md](./docs/CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md)).
- After merges to main, the Copilot-assisted workflow drafts notes and opens a PR to update `docs/repo/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Tag releases manually at first (`v0.1.0`). Later, consider Changesets or semantic‚Äërelease for automated versioning.

### PR changelog guard

This template includes a PR changelog guard that helps ensure every merged change has a human-readable entry in `docs/repo/CHANGELOG.md`.

- When a PR is opened or edited, the guard checks the PR body for a `## Changelog` block. If missing or empty, the guard:

  - Posts an actionable comment with a ready-to-copy changelog scaffold and a link to [CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md](CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md).
  - Adds the label `needs-changelog` to help triage.
  - Fails the workflow so branch protection can block merges until the changelog is added.

- Once the author adds the changelog, editing the PR body will re-run checks automatically. You can also trigger a manual recheck by commenting `/recheck-changelog` (if enabled) ‚Äî see repo workflows.

- Maintainers can bypass the guard by applying a configured bypass label (for example `no-changelog-needed`) or when the PR carries an allowlisted label such as `chore` or `dependabot`.

- The guard also supports lightweight category detection and can add triage labels (for example `security`, `feature`, `fix`) when the changelog contains the corresponding `### Security` / `### Added` / `### Fixed` sections.

Note: enable GitHub Copilot for Pull Requests in the repository settings (Settings ‚Üí Copilot ‚Üí Pull requests) to get AI suggestions for drafting PR descriptions and changelog bullets directly in the PR UI.

## Contributing

See [docs/repo/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/repo/CONTRIBUTING.md). Highlights:

- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`)
- Small, focused PRs using the provided template
- Add/Update tests and docs alongside code
- Fill the `## Changelog` block clearly

Code of Conduct: [docs/repo/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](docs/repo/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Conventional Commits

This repository follows the Conventional Commits convention and enforces it with `commitlint` using the `@commitlint/config-conventional` ruleset (see `.commitlintrc.cjs`).

Looking for the deeper rationale, rule tuning, UX decisions, and CI layering? Read the dedicated case study at [`docs/case-study/commitlint-case-study.md`](docs/case-study/commitlint-case-study.md).

Commit message format (one-line header):

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Where `type` is one of the following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc (no code change)
- refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding or updating tests
- chore: Build process or auxiliary tools changes
- ci: Continuous Integration config and scripts
- revert: Reverts a previous commit

Examples:

- feat(api): add CSV import for CommSec statements
- fix(auth): handle expired tokens in refresh flow
- docs: update README with contributing guidelines
- refactor(db): simplify query builder for clarity
- chore(deps): bump devDependencies

Scope (optional) should be a short noun describing the area affected (for example `api`, `auth`, `ci`).

Keep the header short (‚â§72 chars). If you need a longer explanation, add a blank line and then body paragraphs after the header. For breaking changes include a footer with `BREAKING CHANGE: description`.

For local setup, install commitlint dev dependencies and use a git hook (husky is a common choice) to run `npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"` on commit messages, or rely on CI to validate commit messages on PRs.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Public template MVP (CI, security, PR guard, AI release notes)
- **Phase 2:** Matrix builds, SBOM, preview‚Üírelease environments, docs publishing
- **Phase 3:** AI PR summariser, AI issue triage, telemetry demo & dashboard
- **Phase 4:** Promotion to andrew-dev-standards monorepo with shared packages (eslint/ts/commitlint/changelog tools)

Track enhancements in Issues ‚Üí Milestones.

## FAQ

**Do I have to use pnpm?**  
Nope. Swap to npm/yarn, and update `ci.yml` accordingly.

**What if Copilot is disabled?**  
All automation still works; you just lose AI drafting aids (write changelog/release notes manually).

**Why Apache‚Äë2.0?**  
It‚Äôs permissive with an explicit patent grant ‚Äî friendly for employers. Switch to MIT if you prefer.

**Can I use this for non‚ÄëNode projects?**  
Yes. Replace the scripts and TypeScript config; keep the workflows and docs.
