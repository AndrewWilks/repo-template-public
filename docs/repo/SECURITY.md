# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose a vulnerability.

## Supported Versions

This is a template repository. All released versions (tags) and the `main` branch are supported
for security updates while the template is actively maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. DO NOT open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.
2. Email the maintainers privately at: <me@andrewwilks.au>
   (Replace with a real security contact address for your fork / deployment.)
3. Provide a clear description: impact, affected files / functions, and steps to reproduce.
4. (Optional) Include a minimal proof of concept (PoC). Avoid exploits that could cause data loss.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a triage decision (accepted / needs more info / not a vulnerability).

If you have not received a reply within 7 days, feel free to send a polite follow‑up.

### Vulnerability Handling Process

1. Report received and acknowledged.
2. Triage and reproduce.
3. Determine severity (CVSS-style qualitative: Low / Moderate / High / Critical).
4. Prepare fix + tests.
5. Coordinate disclosure (optional: credit the reporter if desired and consented).
6. Release patch version + update CHANGELOG.
7. Public advisory (GitHub Security Advisory or release notes).

## Guidelines for Reporters

- Act in good faith and avoid privacy violations.
- Do not access, modify, or delete data you do not own.
- Give us reasonable time to patch before any public disclosure.

## Non-Security Issues

Use regular Issues / Discussions for bugs, feature requests, or usability improvements.

## Encryption (Optional)

If you require encrypted email, publish a PGP key for the security contact in your fork.
