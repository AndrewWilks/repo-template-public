age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and

- Showing empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experience

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
