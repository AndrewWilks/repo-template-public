# CAN_BE_REMOVED

This file documents files and directories in the repository that are safe to remove or re-generate and the rationale for doing so.

## Candidates

- `dist/` — build output generated by `pnpm build` / `tsc`. Removing committed `dist/` reduces merge conflicts and keeps source of truth in `src/`. Re-generate with `pnpm build`.
- `.pnpm/`, `.modules.yaml`, `.vite/` — package manager and local tooling artifacts. These are machine-local and should not be committed; they are now ignored by `.gitignore`.
- `configs/.gitkeep`, `docs/.gitkeep` — empty placeholder files. If directories must be preserved, consider adding a short `README.md` instead.

If you think any of the above should remain committed (for example, if consumers expect checked-in `dist/`), please add a note here and we'll retain it.
